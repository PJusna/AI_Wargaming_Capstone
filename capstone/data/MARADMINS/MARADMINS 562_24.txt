GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Authority.  Refs (a) through (g) regulate all
Marine Corps officer promotions.  This message is the authority for
commanding officers to effect promotions.  Per the refs, CMC
(MMPB-10) will not effect an officer's promotion until that
officer's name appears on a promotion MARADMIN or CMC message.
MMPB-10 will mail appropriate commissions to parent commands under
separate cover.  Expect 4-6 weeks for delivery.  The commission is
not the legal authority to promote and is not required to effect the
promotion.  For the purposes of conducting a promotion ceremony,
sample commissions and the oath of office are located in chapter 6
of ref (b) or the Officer Promotions homepage at www.Marines.mil.
Under "Marines/Career," click on "Promotions."  Click on "Officer
Promotions," look under the "Reference" tab on the right side of the
page.

3.  Under the provisions of ref (f), the Secretary of the Navy,

4.  Delay of Promotion
4.a.  Commanding Officer Determination. Per refs (b) and (g), if the
respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not
mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for
promotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the
physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section
10206 of ref (a).  Ref (a) requires written notification to the
officer of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the
appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the
notice shall be given as soon as practicable.  Commanding Officers
must also notify CMC (MMPB-10) prior to the effective date of the
appointment so that the promotion is not effected in Marine Corps
Total Force System (MCTFS) and to allow for the initiation of
administrative action.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain
guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.
4.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this
promotion authority, all officers are screened for adverse or
potentially adverse information. If applicable, CMC (MMPB-10)
removed the names of those officers with records identified during
the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially
adverse information from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those
officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC
(JPL).
5.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary
retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to
acceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion
carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with
augmentation into the regular component.
6.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve
officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have
accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in
paragraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and
allowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion,
an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC
(MMPB-10) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their
promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the
next higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which
signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their
right to decline.
7.  For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-1585 or
DSN 278-1585.  Email inquiries may be submitted via the Officer
Promotions homepage at www.Marines.mil.  Email address is
