TIME ZONE: ROMEO


GENERAL SITUATION.  Our recent offensive attacks in the vicinity of DZ Raven and LZ 7 have continued to show significant success in the battalion’s AO.  However, Montanyan regulars have been sighted along Centralia’s northern border (generally along Rt 646 and Rt 619).  This area to date has seen few coalition operations due to the focus of effort in the southern region of thF Country.  It is believed the MRA is going to try to exploit this gap by renewing their infiltration effort in order to continue to reinforce the CRF insurgency.  The battalion is preparing to move north into a new AO IOT stop these border incursions.  Alpha Company has been tasked to begin planning interdiction operations in the new AO prior to the battalion’s arrival IOT gather information about the enemy and terrain in the area, establish a foothold in the AO and develop the situation.


ORIENTATION.  The platoon’s AO is bounded to the south by MCB-1, Route 646 to the north, the 84 Easting to the west and 619 to the east.  The terrain is typical to the Centralian Highland region and is generally not as steep as the southern regions of the country.  The terrain is broken with numerous fingers and draws especially near water features.  This will create numerous cross compartmental danger areas.  There are numerous creeks, with the two main ones being South Fork and Quantico Creek which bisect the AO from NW to SE.  Route 618 bisects our AO from north to south, and there are numerous trail networks throughout the AO creating linear danger areas.  There are eleven LZ’s in the AO however not all have been surveyed and may not be useable for all aircraft types.  There are also areas which have been partially opened by bombing and burned by incendiaries and are restrictive to foot mobile forces.  The vegetation is thick and visibility is normally restricted to 50-100m, sometimes less than 10m in the low areas.  Off road traffic is generally no go for wheeled and tracked vehicles and slow go for foot mobile troops.


I. SITUATION.
        A. Enemy.
                1. Composition, Disposition, and Strength.  Since we have commenced military operations from DZ Raven and LZ 7, enemy forces were observed withdrawing from the Raven/7 AOs and pushing North both directly into the Northern Centralian Highlands and NE around TA16, then re-entering across the Centralia border from the N.  Currently there is a platoon(+) to company (-) size unit of the MRA conducting squad size and smaller operations.  They have been conducting ambushes, to include two within last 24 hours on relief convoys taking supplies to Centralian civilians.  These patrols are armed with a mix of U.S. and Soviet Block small arms and wear woodland pattern utilities and have typically been squad size elements.  They have limited night vision capability and 82mm mortars. Within the last 48 hours EN UAS has been spotted in the area.
                2. Capabilities and Limitations.
                        (a) Defend.  CRF/MRA forces are continuously mobile, and are limited in their ability to defend, unless they mass to plt size strength.  They will attempt to defend their cache sites at all costs.
                        (b) Reinforce.  CRF/MRA forces could reinforce amongst their fellow squads if they are able to establish communications quickly enough.
                        (c) Attack.  CRF/MRA forces could conduct a deliberate attack if they mass to plt size strength.  They are also capable of attacking like size or larger elements by conducting ambushes.
                        (d) Withdraw.  CRF/MRA forces can withdraw from engagements if given a clear avenue of egress and outnumbered.
                        (e) Delay.  CRF/MRA forces can delay our forces from conducting our stabilization and security mission if given the opportunity.
                3. EMLCOA.  Enemy forces have been forced from the DZ Raven and LZ 7 AOs and are now attempting to establish a presence in terrain further North, believing that we will maintain our presence and not pursue them.  Although our enemy has abandoned AOs when it was proven that we could defeat him in a patrol vs patrol fight, he will continue to fight as squad/FT size elements because of his fear of our indirect fire allowing us to mass on his position if he becomes stagnant.  I believe the enemy will position the majority of his forces throughout the TA16 areas, conducting reconnaissance, attempting to establish safe havens, establishing ingress/egress routes, and gathering information and intelligence on the border regions.  Enemy squad size forces will engage like size and smaller forces and if in an advantageous position, will continue to remain engaged until forced off the terrain or they have reason to believe IDF assets are coming to bear upon them.  If in an equal or disadvantaged position, the enemy will withdrawal from their position.

III. EXECUTION.
        A. Commander’s Intent.
                1. Purpose.  To prevent the MRA from infiltrating through TA16 Province and massing combat power.
                2. Method.  The enemy’s CG is his ability to use covered and concealed routes to infiltrate into and through TA-16.  The enemy’s CV is his inability to quickly reinforce or mass firepower when located.  We will exploit this by conducting a platoon heliborne insert into LZ Peregrine and pushing out squad sized patrols along designated routes throughout our AO.
                3. Endstate.  Enemy prevented from conducting further ambushes of relief convoys or coalition forces in the AO and is unable to mass combat power for an offensive attack into Camp Barrett.  


        B. ConOps.
                1. SOM.  This operation will be conducted in (2) parts.  Part 1 will begin with our heliborne insert into LZ Peregrine and end when each squad has reached its intermediate ORP.  Part 2 will begin with preparation for an ambush patrol at the intermediate ORP and will end with helo extraction from our assigned extraction LZs.
                        (a) Part 1.  Part 1 will begin with our heliborne insert into LZ Peregrine.  Each squad will depart along independent patrol routes to their intermediate ORPs.  Checkpoints will be designated in tasks.  Patrols will report their progress to the platoon commander who will be located at the CoC.  Part 1 will end when each patrol has reached their intermediate LZ, NLT 1500.  
                        (b) Part 2.  Part 2 will begin with ambush patrol preparation at the intermediate ORP.  Each squad will be laid into their ambush site NLT 1845.  Upon completion of the ambush, squads will conduct a night patrol to their extract LZ.  Part 2 will end with helo extraction from extract LZ.  


                        (c)  All squad leaders will pursuant to this order create their own operation order and timeline to support their tasks.  All squads will conduct COC Coordination with the company COC.  


                2. FSP.
                        (a) Task.  Limit the CRF’s ability to affect friendly units with direct fire weapons.
                        (b) Purpose.  IOT allow 1st platoon to move freely throughout the area of operations.
                        (c) Method.  Squads will build their method for their FSP.
                        (d) Effects.  CRF in our area of operations is suppressed.

                9. Rules of Engagement:  Nothing in these ROE will limit your right to take action in SELF-DEFENSE.
                        (a) The CRF and MRF have been declared HOSTILE and MAY BE ATTACKED.  This includes ALL CRF and MONTANYAN military personnel and vehicles TRANSPORTING the ENEMY or ENEMY SUPPLIES.
                        (b) Do NOT attack civilians UNLESS they commit a HOSTILE ACT or it is CLEAR that they are ABOUT TO COMMIT a hostile act (hostile intent) against U.S. Forces.  If a civilian does nothing, they are NOT a threat and may NOT be attacked.
                        
IV. ADMIN AND LOGISTICS.
        A. Administration.
                1. Casualties. Co Corpsman will be located at the company CP, which will be established IVO LZ Peregrine, 18S TH 856 747.  All PLs will generate a CASEVAC plan that takes their casualty to the closest road/trail or LZ.  Any routine casualties that can continue with the mission should do so and be treated upon extract.  Any urgent/priority casualties will be called to the company CP where CASEVAC link-up point will be arranged.  Expect a mobile element, most likely the Bn CAAT to conduct pick-up for priority casualties within 15 minutes of receiving the report.  Expect all urgent casualties to have simultaneous request for Bn CAAT and air CASEVAC.
                2. EPWs. All EPWs taken by patrols will be returned to the company CP for tactical questioning and to be processed to higher echelons.  Detainment authority up to (6) hours lies with any detachment leader (in our case, patrol leaders) and holding longer than (6) hours requires a company commander’s approval.  Ensure that any EPWs/detainees that are taken have actionable evidence that will allow them to be held for further processing.  Treat all with STRESS.
        B. Logistics.  PLs will ensure that all Marines step off w/ four quarts of water and one DOS of chow.
                1. Ammo will be drawn prior to insert.
                2. Radios and extra batteries will be drawn prior to insert.


V. COMMAND AND SIGNAL.
        A. Signal.
                1.  All patrols will utilize company Tac, which will be provided in COC Coordination for all contact with Company.  All CFF missions will be called to Co FiST over Co Tac.
                2.  Co Call Sign:  Alpha Main.
                    Co FiST: Alpha Mortars
                    Sqd Call Signs: Co, Plt, Sqd ie:  “Alpha/1/1”
